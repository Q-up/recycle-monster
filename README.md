# Welcome to Recycle Monster

Recycle monster is a game that teaches proper recycling to its users. There are images of recyclables, compost, and garbage passed through the screen and itâ€™s up to the player to sort them in the right bins before the recycle monster can eat it! The player loses if the monster eats enough recyclables to grow into a fiery giant that destroys the earth.

Created with React PIXI Fiber, Express, and NodeJS
